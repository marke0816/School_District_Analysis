# School_District_Analysis

## Overview

The purpose of this analysis is to inspect grade performance data from various high schools in order to inform budgeting decisions.  We have data on each school's budget, school type, and size so that we may link these metrics to grade performance.  Our contractor, however, has informed us that the district suspects grades have been falsified for the ninth grade students at one of the high schools; therefore, we perform the data analysis on both the original data and the data once we have scrubbed the possibly false grades from Thomas High School's ninth grade class.
